The OCI wrapped up a great 2023 and shipped some new releases and initatives:

* Shipped OCI Runtime Spec 1.1: https://opencontainers.org/release-notices/v1-1-0-runtime-spec/ 
* Established Image Compatibility Working Group: https://github.com/opencontainers/tob/pull/128
* Established FreeBSD Working Group: https://github.com/opencontainers/tob/pull/133

We also started off the new year by shipping runc v1.11:

To further kick off 2024, we are excited to announce the following four board members are joining or returning to the [OCI Technical Oversight Board (TOB)](https://opencontainers.org/about/tob). The TOB comprises independently elected individuals who provide oversight of the technical leadership and serve as a point of appeal. Each member has been elected to serve a two-year term:

* TODO

These TOB members join the following existing members, who are each in the middle of two-year terms:

* Brandon Mitchell [Independent]
* Vincent Batts [Microsoft]
* Derek McGowan [Docker]
* Aleksa Sarai [SUSE]

For outgoing TOB members, we would like to [thank](https://github.com/opencontainers/tob/blob/main/EMERITUS.md) TODOfor their contributions to container standardization!

In 2024, we plan on focusing efforts on improved conformance tooling, security and shipping new versions of the OCI specifications. Join us in Seattle at [Container Plumbing Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/container-plumbing-days/)!
